The README file for "Exploring Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints to Predict mTOR Inhibitors using Machine Learning Techniques".

1. The directory mTOR_GitHub contains all the source code used in above mentioned paper. 

(a) The subdirectory RFVIM contains the source code to calculate Random Forest Variable Importance Measures (RF-VIM) such as Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) values. The source Code for classification models based on MDA and MDG-ranked top 10, 20, 30 AND 40 molecular descriptors with correlation coeffaicient <0.75. 

(b) mTORautoencoder.R

The source code and architecture of autoencoder to reduce MACCS Fingerprints (FPs).

(c) mTORFP.R

The source Code for classification models based on reduced MACCS FPs.

(d) mTORFSNNVIM1_4fp.R

The source Code for classification models using Hybrid feature set generated by combining best performing molecular descriptors and MACCS FPs.

(e) mTORdescriptor_mda.csv

The ranked descriptors with assigned MDA values. 

(f) mTORdescriptor_mdg.csv

The ranked descriptors with assigned MDG values.
